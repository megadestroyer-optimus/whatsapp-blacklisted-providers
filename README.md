# WhatsApp API Blacklisted Providers

I know when you're trying to search reliable WhatsApp API you may easily get frustrated because of mess illegal stuff going out in Intenet today. So that is why i've decided to make a list of WhatsApp API providers that violate (Whatsapp Therms of Service)[https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service]. Any provider in the list is already compromised itself. It means that Meta and Whatsapp already know about it
