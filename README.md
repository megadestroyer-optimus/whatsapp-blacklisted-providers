# Actual WhatsApp API Blacklisted cloud Providers

I know when you're trying to search reliable WhatsApp API you may easily get frustrated because of lot a mess illegal stuff going out in Intenet today. Especially when you don't know that most of unnoficial  WhatsApp API are hiding theirs illegal status. So that's why i've decided to make a list of WhatsApp API providers that deliberately violate [WhatsApp Therms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) to earn money. WhatsApp has a statement about unnoficial apps that is placed here [About unofficial apps](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1217634902127718)

## Official Business WhatsApp API providers
These are legally authorized by Meta with WhatsApp. They are safe and secure. They can be found here on [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/business/partner-directory/search?solution_type=messaging&platforms=whatsapp)

## Unnoficial illegal WhatsApp API Providers
These are third party cloud providers that are not owned by WhatsApp or anything and they may be object of legal threats. Any provider in the list is compromised itself since it is here and Meta with WhatsApp likely know about them already.  You should use this info realizing all possible risks.
