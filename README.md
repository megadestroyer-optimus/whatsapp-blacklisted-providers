Especially when you know that most of unnoficial  Whatsapp API are hiding theirs illegal status.  So that's why i've decided to make a list of WhatsApp API providers that violate [Whatsapp Therms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) . Any provider in the list is already compromised itself. Likely  Meta and Whatsapp already know about it. You can use this info for own purposes and realizing the risks
